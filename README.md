  Wikipedia is free to use and edit, allowing all types of people to post their knowledge of a topic or discuss their opinions on the talk page. Although the free-to-edit usage of Wikipedia promotes collaboration, ethical concerns will apply. Bias will slip through to the articles from a variety of reasons, including cultural background, beliefs, and personal perspective. The type of topic being discussed certainly results in different levels of bias, driving the question: Is bias on Wikipedia more likely to appear in cultural topics, where values differ, than in scientific topics? 
  The paper, "The distorted mirror of Wikipedia: a quantitative analysis of Wikipedia coverage of academics," takes a look at scientific articles posted on Wikipedia, analyzing its content. It writes, "Many highly cited, top scientists have no Wikipedia article at all, while some less notable academics have long, detailed articles because they are more 'public-facing' or popular. As noted by Samoilenko and Yasseri (2014), 'We found no statistically significant correlation between Wikipedia articles' metrics (length, number of edits, number of incoming links from other articles, etc.) and academic notability of the mentioned researchers. ' This shows how Wikipedia's representation of academics is influenced more by editors' personal interests than by its academic significance.
  The paper Cultural Bias in Wikipedia Content on Famous Persons looks into how Wikipedia articles about famous individuals vary across different language editions, which shows the cultural influences on content. It says, "Articles about the same famous person differ significantly between language editions, reflecting the interests and perspectives of each cultural community." As noted by Callahan and Herring (2011), "The differences in emphasis, inclusion, and framing demonstrate that local cultural values shape how information is presented on Wikipedia." This is saying that Wikipedia's representation of cultural topics is influenced more by contributorsâ€™ cultural perspectives and values than by any objective measure.
  Wikipedia is a very useful source of information, but beware it can often be biased. Even scientific articles are affected by what editors choose to include, and cultural articles are often influenced by different values and perspectives. Readers should always keep this in mind when using Wikipedia, however, they should not be discouraged from using it.

A question I had when writing this is: Can ML models help detect bias if they themselves are inherently biased?
